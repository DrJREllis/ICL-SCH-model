## Adherence
adherenceSetting	random		## which adherence setting to use. Legal values are currently "random", "semi-systematic" or "systematic".
propNeverCompliers	0.25	## The proportion of the population who never comply. Note if this is non-zero, the coverages will still be applied *as if to the whole population*. So the coverages above should be adjusted in this case; adjusted cov = cov/(1-propNeverCompliers).
