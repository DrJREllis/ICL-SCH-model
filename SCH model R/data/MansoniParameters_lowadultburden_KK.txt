#### Mansoni parameter values. 

### Model running parameters.
repNum	50		Number of repetitions
nYears	71		Number of years to run
nHosts	500		Size of definitive host population (N)
outputEvents	50 51.05 55 60 70	output events. 


### Social structure
contactAgeBreaks	0 5 10 16 80		Contact age group breaks (minus sign necessary to include zero age) anderson et al 2016 chp Matithini
betaValues	0.01 1.2 1 0.02				Relative contact rates (Beta) anderson et al 2016 chp Matithini#kk infection rates, SAC hve the highest infection rate
#rhoValues	1 1 1 1				Rho, contribution to the reservoir by contact age group. 
rhoValues	0.01 1.2 1 0.02				Rho, contribution to the reservoir by contact age group. #KK this needs to be the same as beta

### Epidemiological parameters. 
k	0.24			Shape parameter of assumed negative binomial distribution of worms amongst host (k). THIS VALUE PLUCKED OUT OF THE AIR. -anderson et al 2016 chp
lambda	0.14		Eggs per gram (lambda) [Value from Chan = 7.0] ### 0.14 value from de Vlas/Cheever. 
R0	1.30485			Basic reproductive number (R0) lower setting  ## 1.6687 higher setting
ReservoirDecayRate	5	Reservoir decay rate (decay rate of eggs in the environment)
sigma	0.25		Worm death rate (sigma) i.e. 1/worm_life_span, same for all development stages
gamma	0.0007	Exponential density dependence of parasite adult stage (gamma) This value probably comes from Cheever. -anderson et al 2016 chp

### Sexual reproduction styles. 
reproFuncName	epgMonog	## name of function for reproduction (a string).  [Deterministic] ## epgPerPerson   epgFertility	epgMonog
StochSR	TRUE		## Turn SR on or off in the stochastic model. 	[Stochastic]  ## FALSE

## Treatment parameters. 
treatmentBreaks	0 2 5 15 80		Minimum age of each treatment group (minus sign necessary to include zero age): Infants; Pre-SAC; SAC; Adults #KK setting the same age breaks as previously
coverage	0 0 0.75 0		Coverages: Infants; Pre-SAC; SAC; Adults #KK we are treating 75% of SAC group only
drugEff	0.86					Drug efficacy
treatStart	100.05				Treatment year start; Treatment year end; Frequency of treatment by year. ADDED A BIT TO ENSURE OUTPUT FIRST. #KK we run the modelfor 100 years without treatment and then start treatment after that.
nRounds	7					Number of treatment rounds. 
treatInterval	1			interval between treatments in years. #KK we are treating once a year for 7 years

## Output age classes. 
outputBreaks	0 2 5 15 80		## What are the output age classes? #KK see how many 0-2 are infected, 2-5 are infected etc after treatment

## High worm burden.  DUMMY VALUES DUMMY VALUES DUMMY VALUES DUMMY VALUES DUMMY VALUES 
highBurdenBreaks	0 5 10 100	## Three categories here. 
highBurdenValues	10 15 20	## Corresponding values. #KK the burden vlues stay fixed. They are from WHO definition of what high burden is.
